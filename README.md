# mdforest - Markdown Forest

A library to convert Markdown documents into tree data structures and vice versa. There is greater functionality available to modify, prune, add and delete parts of documents when there are in the MarkdownTree structure.

markdown-tree is a fork of [md2py](https://github.com/alvinwan/md2py) which is no longer maintained. This library adds far more functionality and broadens the scope of the older libary. The full list of features can be found under [Features](## Features)

## Install

Install via pip

```bash
pip install markdown-tree
```

You can find the library page here [here](nil)

## Quick Usage Guide

Markdown2Python offers only one function `md2py`, which generates a Python
object from markdown text. This object is a navigable, "Tree of Contents"
abstraction for the markdown file.

Take, for example, the following markdown file.

[[ chikin.md ]]

```markdown
# Chikin Tales

Once there was a chikin.

## Chapter 1 : Chikin Fly

Chickens don't fly. They do only the following:

- waddle
- plop 


### Waddling

A waddle is what these birds do.

## Chapter 2 : Chikin Scream

### Plopping

Plopping involves three steps:

1. squawk
2. plop
3. repeat, unless ordered to squat

```

Akin to a navigation bar, the `TreeOfContents` object allows you to expand a
markdown file one level at a time. Running `md2py` on the above markdown file
will generate a tree, abstracting the below structure.

```text
               Chikin Tales
              /     \       \
             /       \       \ 
       (Once th..)    |       \
                      |        \
                  Chapter 1     \
                  /     |     Chapter 2   
                 /      |         |
       (Chickens do..)  |       Plopping
                        |         |
                     Waddling   (Plopping...)
                        |
                    (A waddle...)


```

## Features

Some of the features of this library are:

1. Converts a markdown file to a manipulatable, light Python data structure.
2. Converts the Python data structure back into a Markdown file.
3. Traverse and edit the Python data structure.
