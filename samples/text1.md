# Appendices 

## Appendix I: The Ecology of Dune.
This appendix details “the ecology of Dune.” It is heavily focused on the story of Pardot Kynes, Arrakis's first planetologist. 
The appendix begins with an epigraph by Pardot Kynes in which he considers the kind of existence available when humans increase in number in a finite environment
Pardot Kynes is fixated on the potential for Fremen—an indigenous and hardy Arrakeen society—to reshape the environment on Arrakis to suit their wants and needs. He is single-minded in his desire to terraform Arrakis into a lush and “man-healthy” planet. 
To aid this mission, he marries a Fremen woman and begins teaching Fremen children (including his own child Liet-Kynes) the ecological awareness that they require to be able to reshape Arrakeen landscapes to suit their needs and desires.


## Appendix II: The Religion of Dune.
Before the coming of [[Muad'Dib]], the Fremen of Arrakis practiced a religion whose roots in the Maometh Saari are there for any scholar to see. Many have traced the extensive borrowings from other religions. The most common example is the Hymn to Water, a direct copy from the Orange Catholic Liturgical Manual, calling for rain clouds which Arrakis had never seen. But there are more profound points of accord between the Kitab al-Ibar of the Fremen and the teachings of Bible, Ilm, and Fiqh.

Any comparison of the religious beliefs dominant in the Imperium up to the time of Muad'Dib must start with the major forces which shaped those beliefs:

1. The followers of the Fourteen Sages, whose Book was the [[Orange Catholic Bible]], and whose views are expressed in the Commentaries and other literature produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators. (C.E.T.).
2. The Bene Gesserit, who privately denied they were a religious order, but who operated behind an almost impenetrable screen of ritual mysticism, and whose training, whose symbolism, organization, and internal teaching methods were almost wholly religious.
3. The agnostic ruling class (including the Guild) for whom religion was a kind of puppet show to amuse the populace and keep it docile, and who believed essentially that all phenomena - even religious phenomena - could be reduced to mechanical explanations.
4. The so-called [[Ancient Teachings]] - including those preserved by the Zensunni Wanderers from the first, second, and [[third Islamic movements]]; the Navachristianity of Chusuk, the Buddislamic Variants of the types dominant at Lankiveil and Sikun, the Blend Books of the Mahayana Lankavatara, the Zen Hekiganshu of III Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and Talmudic Zabur surviving on Salusa Secundus, the pervasive Obeah Ritual, the Muadh Quran with its pure Ilm and Fiqh preserved among the pundi rice farmers of Caladan, the Hindu outcroppings found all through the universe in little pockets of insulated pyons, and finally, the Butlerian Jihad.

There is a fifth force which shaped religious belief, but its effect is so universal and profound that it deserves to stand alone.

## Appendix III: Report on Bene Gesserit Motives and Purposes.
This appendix details a “report on Bene Gesserit motives and purpose.”
The narrator introduces it by noting that Lady Jessica commissioned the report directly after the “Arrakis Affair.” 
The document is noted as being extremely honest in tone.

## Appendix IV: The Almanak eb-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)
This appendix details selected excerpts about the noble Houses of Dune. The first entry discusses the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino. His rule is most significant for the “Arrakis Revolt,” which historians ascribe to his poor court politics. 
The Emperor's wife died some years earlier, and he has five daughters and no sons.

A maternal cousin of House Corrin, Count Hasimir Fenring is the Emperor Shaddam IV's closest companion.
His work for the Emperor included duties as an Imperial Agent during the Harkonnen rule on that planet; the Emperor later assigned him to govern Caladan. 
Count Fenring later joined the Emperor “in retirement on Salusa Secundus.”
