This appendix details “the ecology of Dune.” It is heavily focused on the story of Pardot Kynes, Arrakis's first planetologist. 
The appendix begins with an epigraph by Pardot Kynes in which he considers the kind of existence available when humans increase in number in a finite environment
Pardot Kynes is fixated on the potential for Fremen—an indigenous and hardy Arrakeen society—to reshape the environment on Arrakis to suit their wants and needs. He is single-minded in his desire to terraform Arrakis into a lush and “man-healthy” planet. 
To aid this mission, he marries a Fremen woman and begins teaching Fremen children (including his own child Liet-Kynes) the ecological awareness that they require to be able to reshape Arrakeen landscapes to suit their needs and desires.
